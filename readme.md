**Middleware Functions in Node.js**

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects in a Node.js application.

**Flow:**

```
REQUEST >>>>>>>>>>>>>>---- | MIDDLEWARE | ---->>>>>>>>>>>>>>> RESPONSE
```

**Common Uses of Middleware:**

- Authorization and authentication
- Logging
- Parsing request bodies
- Error handling
- Modifying request or response objects

**How to Add Middleware to Your App:**

To apply middleware to all routes in your app, use the following syntax:

```javascript
app.use(middlewareFunction);
```

This ensures that the specified middleware is executed for every incoming request.

Middleware functions act like checkpoints in your application's request-response cycle. You can have multiple middleware functions, each performing a specific task before the request reaches the final response.

Flow:

REQUEST >>>> m1 >>>> m2 >>>> m3 >>>> RESPONSE

Here’s the revised explanation:

**Middleware as Checkpoints in Node.js**

Middleware functions act like checkpoints in your application's request-response cycle. You can have multiple middleware functions, each performing a specific task before the request reaches the final response.

**Flow:**

```
REQUEST >>>> m1 >>>> m2 >>>> m3 >>>> RESPONSE
```

**Middleware Functions:**
Middleware functions have access to the `req` (request), `res` (response), and `next()` function. The `next()` function is crucial as it passes control to the next middleware in the stack.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // middleware logic here
  next();
});
```

You can stack multiple middleware functions, and they will execute in the order they are defined. Each middleware can modify the request or response objects, handle errors, or perform other operations before passing control to the next middleware using `next()`.
Here’s a simplified explanation:

**Using Middleware in Node.js**

1. **Global Middleware with `app.use()`**:

   - The `app.use()` method applies middleware to all routes in your app. This means that every request will go through this middleware before reaching the route handler.

2. **Middleware for Specific Routes**:

   - If you want to apply middleware to a specific route only, you place the middleware between the route path and the route handler.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.get("/getUserById/:id", middlewareFunction, (req, res) => {
       res.send("User data");
     });
     ```
   - In this example, `middlewareFunction` will run only when someone accesses the `/getUserById/:id` route.

3. **Adding Multiple Middleware to a Route**:
   - You can add more than one middleware function to a route by listing them in order before the route handler.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.get("/getUserById/:id", middleware1, middleware2, (req, res) => {
       res.send("User data");
     });
     ```
   - Here, `middleware1` will run first, followed by `middleware2`, and then the route handler will send the response. Each middleware function can do something with the `req` and `res` objects, and then pass control to the next middleware using `next()`.

- Use `app.use()` to apply middleware to all routes.
- For specific routes, place middleware between the route path and handler.
- Stack multiple middleware functions by listing them in order before the route handler.
  Here’s the rewritten explanation:

**Problem: Handling Non-Matching Routes in Node.js**

To ensure that your application returns "404 - Page Not Found" when a route doesn’t match any of the defined routes, you can add a middleware function at the end of all your routes using `app.use()`.

### Solution:

1. **Place `app.use()` at the End**:

   - After defining all your routes, add a final middleware with `app.use()` that catches any unmatched routes.

2. **Example Implementation**:

   ```javascript
   // Define your routes first
   app.get("/home", (req, res) => {
     res.send("Welcome to the Home Page");
   });

   app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
     res.send("About Us");
   });

   // Catch-all middleware for non-matching routes
   app.use((req, res) => {
     res.status(404).send("404 - Page Not Found");
   });
   ```

   - **Explanation**: The `app.use()` at the end acts as a catch-all for any routes that weren’t matched by the previous route handlers. When a request doesn’t match any defined route, this middleware sends a "404 - Page Not Found" response.

**Summary**:

- Add your `app.use()` at the end of all route definitions.
- This middleware will catch any unmatched routes and return a "404 - Page Not Found" response.
